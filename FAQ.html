              This year too, talent shortage is a big concern for most
              recruiters. Some 70 per cent of the recruiters say the right
              talent as a major challenge. Their next big grouse was the high
              salary expectations from a Fresh job seeker. All IT students come
              with a dream of joining IT companies after their graduation. It
              has been time and again stated by the recruiting companies that
              only a small percentage of these graduates are employable since
              the students lack in IT skills and also communication skills.

            WHY TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION?

              A certificate is a credential that tells an employer that you have
              a specific skill. Certification is the right to distinguish you as
              a “Certified Professional”. Training is a proven method that has
              become widely accepted in the industry. The SSIT Training Program
              will establish an industry standard of excellence.

              My experience with SSIT was incredible. I got placed with my dream
              company Deloitte. SSIT has the best and most helpful trainers and
              placement cell. For every challenge that I faced, I received
              guidance. The exposure here added a lot to my confidence and
              presentation skills. Even during the final placements, when I was
              struggling in my initial interviews, the trainers and placement
              team helped me identify my weaknesses and overcome those. I am so
              grateful for my time here.
